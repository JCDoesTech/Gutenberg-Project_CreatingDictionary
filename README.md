# Gutenberg-Project_CreatingDictionary

## Goal
To take an e-book from gutenburg.ca and, after removing the preamble and credits so that just the text itself remains, create a dictionary of words from the book that are at least three letters long and begin with a lowercase letter.

## Features
- The use of regex to determine that the word begins with a lower case so easily adaptable to different requirements
- The word length condition is based upon the .length() method so adaptation to other requirements is simple

## Documentation
Please see the docs folder where the JavaDoc is located
